# Hosting A Resume on Github

## Purpose
The purpose of this readme file is to describe how to host and format a resume using various software stacks. This will also include steps that introduce, demonstrate and relate the principles of Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing

## Prerequisites
Two things will be required before we move on to elaborate how to host a resume:
  1. [Resume](https://sevenrl.github.io/) to use to host
  2. A decent tutorial to get us started (*linked urder **More Resources***)

## Instructions

1. Click on the '+' icon in the top right and create a new repository
2. Name the repository starting with your username and adding .github.io at the end, all one word, this is the link where the website will be hosted
3. The next step is we need an index.md file, as well as a config file
4. To get the config file, go to the repository's settings on the tab next to Insights
5. Scroll down till you find Github Pages
6. From here, you can choose an appropriate theme to support the resume
